## React redux toolkit demo

A repository to demonstrate usage of redux toolkit with react and javascript , while create a todo list application

### Notes

`Redux` or for that matter any state management library came into existance , due to a problem that data/state of the application is not available at a central place inside the application and in order to pass data between the react components we use to have prop drilling but again that comes at a cost that , the component that doesnot even needs the data have to accept it and as the component/application grows it becomes a tedious task to manage the application.

## Evolution

`Flow` ==> `Redux` ==> `React-Redux` (binding for react using react) ==> `Redux tool kit`
